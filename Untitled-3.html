	<p>Hi there! My name is Stephanie Hurley, and I'm 25 years old originally from Fort Bragg, North Carolina.<br>
 Growing up, I was always interested in a variety of activities, but some of my favorites were video games, rollerblading, and horseback riding.<br>


I've always been fascinated by the immersive worlds that video games can create, and I love the challenge of mastering new games and techniques. Rollerblading is another activity that I've enjoyed for many years, as it allows me to get outside and stay active while exploring my surroundings.<br>


But perhaps my biggest passion is horseback riding. I've been riding horses since I was a child, and there's nothing quite like the feeling of galloping through a field with the wind in my hair. It's a thrilling and grounding experience all at once.<br>
I started working with my hands with my father around the age of 15 since he was always working on a project in our garage, and it looked like interesting work. He taught me the basics of woodworking and some welding, although I was a bit timid of the sparks at first glance. <br>
I moved to raleigh at the age of 18 and loved it and have been here ever since, with lots of opportunity around me I decided to start the journey of running my own business, and have been working toward that goal ever since.<br>
Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I'm excited to see where life takes me next!</p>
